# binary_search
A collection of binary search implementations

Errors to avoid : 

  1. Off-by-one errors when calculating the boundaries of the interval.
  
  2. Handling duplicate items may require that the position of the first 
     instance be returned.
  
  3. Over- and underflows when calculating indices for very large arrays.

  4. Handling empty arrays.
